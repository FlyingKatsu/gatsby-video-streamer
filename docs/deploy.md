# Deploy your Website

The official GatsbyJS documentation describes several methods for deploying to various web services, but note that some services, like Netlify, limit your upload file sizes to 10MB, which is not viable for video files.

The [Live Demo](https://demo.flyingkatsu.com/video-stream) runs on NGINX with an HTTPS certification from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/client-options/). 

Note: If you want videos to be shared via Twitter cards, you need to have HTTPS enabled!

The file structure looks like this:

```
www/
    _stream/
        dash/
            my-video/
                stream.mpd
                audio/
                video/
        hls/
            my-video/
                stream.m3u8
                segment.ts
    public/
        blog/
        playlist/
        video/
        static/
        index.html
```

where  
- `_stream` contains all the necessary stream files, with the original directory structure preserved
- `public` contains all the files generated by `gatsby build` or `npm run build`


NOTE: The demo videos are not viewable due to request timeouts. A Raspberry Pi server does not seem strong enough for online video streaming.
